road trip planner (hotels)
    Given two cities, find different routes between them that finds hotels to stay
    at along the way. Will recommend 3 routes: the fastest route, least expensive route (hotel price), and
    most eventful (most activities) route. Can also add gas/refueling stations as part of the route planning.
movie recommend
    give closest theater showing a movie. also recommend a movie based music playlist.

Others:
book to music playlist
    given a text, generate music based off it.
food availability
    given seasonal foods/ingredients/user preference, recommend recipes, and where to get the ingredients.
    can limit by budget, and add filters (vegan, gluten-free, etc.).
neighborhood rater
some music thing
    guessing game. given a list of artists (genre, mood), play sound Wordle off of that
    list of songs.
